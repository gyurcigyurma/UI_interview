 All right, before we head out, few things to remember. 
 First of all, remember that the first rule of functions is that they are small. And what's the second rule? That's, that's right, they're smaller than that. Remember that lots of little, well-named functions will save you and everybody lots of time because they're gonna act like signposts along the way, helping everybody navigate through your code. Remember that most of us don't have to worry about the efficiency of function-call overhead.
 In almost every case, worrying about how long it takes to call a function is probably misplaced. Remember that making functions small will save you and everybody time. Remember that classes hide in long functions. And that if you want to properly partition your program into classes, keep your functions small. Remember that functions do one thing, and the only way to really be sure that a function does one thing is to Extract Till You Drop Right? Extract Till You Drop. Let me repeat that! If you can extract one function from another, you should, because that original function was, by definition, doing more than one thing. If you do all these things, my scouts, you will be keeping your code very very clean indeed.
