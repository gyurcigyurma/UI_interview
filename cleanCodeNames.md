### Names as Uncle Bob ###
1. Choose your names thoughtfully
2. Commuicate your intent
3. Avoid Disinformation
4. Pronounceable Names
5. Avoid Encodings (i.e. Hungarian Notaton,) and no pzs and iu_ prefixes!
6. Grady Booch: Clean Code should always read like well-written prose.Choose Parse of Speech well. 
    Give classes noun names.
    Give variables nouns.
    Give methods verb names.     
    If they're Booleans, make them predicates. Make sure that when you write a line of code, it looks like and reads like a sentence.
    
7. The Scope Rule.    
    Finally, remember the scope rule. Variable names should be short, even one letter, if they're in a tiny little scope. But variable names should be long if they're in a big long scope. Global variable names, if you have them, should be very long and deep. Functions follow the opposite rule. Function names should be short if they've got a long scope. Function names should be long and descriptive, if they have a short scope. And the same rule goes for classes. Nice, short names for public classes. Longer names for private classes in tiny scopes.
    
Remember Martin Fowler's reprimand. Any fool can write code a computer can understand. But it takes a good programmer to write code a human can understand...
