How browsers work
=================

The main function of a browser is to present the web resource you choose, by requesting it from the server and displaying it in the browser window. The resource is usually an HTML document, but may also be a PDF, image, or some other type of content. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). The way the browser interprets and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications.

### The browser's main components

* __User interface:__ this includes the address bar, back/forward button, bookmarking menu, etc. Every part of the browser display except the window where you see the requested page.
* __Browser engine:__ marshals actions between the UI and the rendering engine.
* __Rendering engine:__ responsible for displaying requested content. For example if the requested content is HTML, the rendering engine parses HTML and CSS, and displays the parsed content on the screen.
  * __Networking:__ for network calls such as HTTP requests, using different implementations for different platform behind a platform-independent interface.
  * __UI backend:__ used for drawing basic widgets like combo boxes and windows. This backend exposes a generic interface that is not platform specific. Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.
  * __JavaScript interpreter:__ Used to parse and execute JavaScript code.
  * __Data storage:__ This is a persistence layer. The browser may need to save all sorts of data locally, such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL and FileSystem.

It is important to note that browsers such as Chrome run multiple instances of the rendering engine: one for each tab. Each tab runs in a separate process.

### Rendering engine

The rendering engine will start getting the contents of the requested document from the networking layer. This will usually be done in 8kB chunks.

The rendering engine will start parsing the HTML document and convert elements to DOM nodes in a tree called the "content tree". The engine will parse the style data, both in external CSS files and in style elements. Styling information together with visual instructions in the HTML will be used to create another tree: the render tree.

The render tree contains rectangles with visual attributes like color and dimensions. The rectangles are in the right order to be displayed on the screen.

After the construction of the render tree it goes through a "layout" process. This means giving each node the exact coordinates where it should appear on the screen. The next stage is painting â€“ the render tree will be traversed and each node will be painted using the UI backend layer.

It's important to understand that this is a gradual process. For better user experience, the rendering engine will try to display contents on the screen as soon as possible. It will not wait until all HTML is parsed before starting to build and layout the render tree. Parts of the content will be parsed and displayed, while the process continues with the rest of the contents that keeps coming from the network.

### Parsing

Parsing a document means translating it to a structure the code can use. Parsing is based on the syntax rules the document obeys: the language or format it was written in. Every format you can parse must have deterministic grammar consisting of vocabulary and syntax rules. It is called a context free grammar.

Parsing can be separated into two sub processes: lexical analysis and syntax analysis. Lexical analysis is the process of breaking the input into tokens. Tokens are the language vocabulary: the collection of valid building blocks. Syntax analysis is the applying of the language syntax rules.

```
Document -> Lexical Analysis -> Syntax Analysis -> Parse Tree
```

__Translation:__ The compiler that compiles source code into machine code first parses it into a parse tree and then translates the tree into a machine code document.

```
Source Code -> Parsing -> Parse Tree -> Translation -> Machine Code
```

### HTML Parser

HTML cannot be parsed easily by conventional parsers, since its grammar is not context free. HTML cannot be parsed by XML parsers. This appears strange at first sight; HTML is rather close to XML. There are lots of available XML parsers. The difference is that the HTML approach is more "forgiving": it lets you omit certain tags (which are then added implicitly), or sometimes omit start or end tags, and so on. On the whole it's a "soft" syntax, as opposed to XML's stiff and demanding syntax.

__DOM:__ The output tree (the "parse tree") is a tree of DOM element and attribute nodes. DOM is short for Document Object Model. It is the object presentation of the HTML document and the interface of HTML elements to the outside world like JavaScript. The root of the tree is the "Document" object. The DOM has an almost one-to-one relation to the markup. Like HTML, DOM is specified by the W3C organization. The tree is constructed of elements that implement one of the DOM interfaces.

__The parsing algorithm:__ The parsing algorithm is described in detail by the HTML5 specification. The algorithm consists of two stages: tokenization and tree construction. Tokenization is the lexical analysis, parsing the input into tokens. Among HTML tokens are start tags, end tags, attribute names and attribute values. The tokenizer recognizes the token, gives it to the tree constructor, and consumes the next character for recognizing the next token, and so on until the end of the input.

__The tokenization algorithm:__ The algorithm's output is an HTML token. The algorithm is expressed as a state machine. Each state consumes one or more characters of the input stream and updates the next state according to those characters. The decision is influenced by the current tokenization state and by the tree construction state. This means the same consumed character will yield different results for the correct next state, depending on the current state.

__Tree construction algorithm:__ During the tree construction stage the DOM tree with the Document in its root will be modified and elements will be added to it. Each node emitted by the tokenizer will be processed by the tree constructor. For each token the specification defines which DOM element is relevant to it and will be created for this token. The element is added to the DOM tree, and also the stack of open elements. This stack is used to correct nesting mismatches and unclosed tags. The algorithm is also described as a state machine. The states are called "insertion modes".

__Actions when the parsing is finished:__ At this stage the browser will mark the document as interactive and start parsing scripts that are in "deferred" mode: those that should be executed after the document is parsed. The document state will be then set to "complete" and a "load" event will be fired.

### CSS Parser

CSS is a context free grammar, and the CSS specification defines CSS lexical and syntax grammar. WebKit uses Flex and Bison parser generators to create parsers automatically from the CSS grammar files. As you recall from the parser introduction, Bison creates a bottom up shift-reduce parser. Firefox uses a top down parser written manually. In both cases each CSS file is parsed into a StyleSheet object. Each object contains CSS rules. The CSS rule objects contain selector and declaration objects and other objects corresponding to CSS grammar.

Conceptually it seems that since style sheets don't change the DOM tree, there is no reason to wait for them and stop the document parsing. There is an issue, though, of scripts asking for style information during the document parsing stage. If the style is not loaded and parsed yet, the script will get wrong answers and apparently this caused lots of problems. It seems to be an edge case but is quite common. Firefox blocks all scripts when there is a style sheet that is still being loaded and parsed. WebKit blocks scripts only when they try to access certain style properties that may be affected by unloaded style sheets.

__Render tree construction:__ While the DOM tree is being constructed, the browser constructs another tree, the render tree. This tree is of visual elements in the order in which they will be displayed. It is the visual representation of the document. The purpose of this tree is to enable painting the contents in their correct order. Firefox calls the elements in the render tree "frames". WebKit uses the term renderer or render object. A renderer knows how to lay out and paint itself and its children. Each renderer represents a rectangular area usually corresponding to a node's CSS box, as described by the CSS2 spec. It includes geometric information like width, height and position.

__The render tree relation to the DOM tree:__ The renderers correspond to DOM elements, but the relation is not one to one. Non-visual DOM elements will not be inserted in the render tree. An example is the "head" element. Also elements whose display value was assigned to "none" will not appear in the tree (whereas elements with "hidden" visibility will appear in the tree). There are DOM elements which correspond to several visual objects. These are usually elements with complex structure that cannot be described by a single rectangle. Some render objects correspond to a DOM node but not in the same place in the tree. Floats and absolutely positioned elements are out of flow, placed in a different part of the tree, and mapped to the real frame. A placeholder frame is where they should have been.

__The flow of constructing the tree:__ In Firefox, the presentation is registered as a listener for DOM updates. The presentation delegates frame creation to the FrameConstructor and the constructor resolves style (see style computation) and creates a frame. In WebKit the process of resolving the style and creating a renderer is called "attachment". Every DOM node has an "attach" method. Attachment is synchronous, node insertion to the DOM tree calls the new node "attach" method.

Processing the html and body tags results in the construction of the render tree root. The root render object corresponds to what the CSS spec calls the containing block: the top most block that contains all other blocks. Its dimensions are the viewport: the browser window display area dimensions. Firefox calls it ViewPortFrame and WebKit calls it RenderView. This is the render object that the document points to. The rest of the tree is constructed as a DOM nodes insertion.

__Style Computation:__ Building the render tree requires calculating the visual properties of each render object. This is done by calculating the style properties of each element. The style includes style sheets of various origins, inline style elements and visual properties in the HTML. The later is translated to matching CSS style properties.

The style contexts contain end values. The values are computed by applying all the matching rules in the correct order and performing manipulations that transform them from logical to concrete values. For example, if the logical value is a percentage of the screen it will be calculated and transformed to absolute units. The rule tree idea is really clever. It enables sharing these values between nodes to avoid computing them again. This also saves space.

All the matched rules are stored in a tree. The bottom nodes in a path have higher priority. The tree contains all the paths for rule matches that were found. Storing the rules is done lazily. The tree isn't calculated at the beginning for every node, but whenever a node style needs to be computed the computed paths are added to the tree.

When computing the style context for a certain element, we first compute a path in the rule tree or use an existing one. We then begin to apply the rules in the path to fill the structs in our new style context. We start at the bottom node of the pathâ€“the one with the highest precedence (usually the most specific selector) and traverse the tree up until our struct is full.

After parsing the style sheet, the rules are added to one of several hash maps, according to the selector. There are maps by id, by class name, by tag name and a general map for anything that doesn't fit into those categories. If the selector is an id, the rule will be added to the id map, if it's a class it will be added to the class map etc. This manipulation makes it much easier to match rules. There is no need to look in every declaration: we can extract the relevant rules for an element from the maps. This optimization eliminates 95+% of the rules, so that they need not even be considered during the matching process.

### Cascade order

__Style sheet cascade order:__ A declaration for a style property can appear in several style sheets, and several times inside a style sheet. This means the order of applying the rules is very important. This is called the "cascade" order. According to CSS2 spec, the cascade order is (from low to high):

* Browser declarations
* User normal declarations
* Author normal declarations
* Author important declarations
* User important declarations

Declarations with the same order will be sorted by specificity and then the order they are specified. The HTML visual attributes are translated to matching CSS declarations. They are treated as author rules with low priority.

__Specificity:__

* count 1 if the declaration it is from is a 'style' attribute rather than a rule with a selector, 0 otherwise (= a)
* count the number of ID attributes in the selector (= b)
* count the number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= c)
* count the number of element names and pseudo-elements in the selector (= d)

Concatenating the four numbers a-b-c-d (in a number system with a large base) gives the specificity.

Some examples:
```
*             {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=0 -> specificity = 0,0,0,0 */
li            {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=1 -> specificity = 0,0,0,1 */
li:first-line {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=2 -> specificity = 0,0,0,2 */
ul li         {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=2 -> specificity = 0,0,0,2 */
ul ol+li      {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=0 d=3 -> specificity = 0,0,0,3 */
h1 + *[rel=up]{}  /* a=0 b=0 c=1 d=1 -> specificity = 0,0,1,1 */
ul ol li.red  {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=1 d=3 -> specificity = 0,0,1,3 */
li.red.level  {}  /* a=0 b=0 c=2 d=1 -> specificity = 0,0,2,1 */
#x34y         {}  /* a=0 b=1 c=0 d=0 -> specificity = 0,1,0,0 */
style=""          /* a=1 b=0 c=0 d=0 -> specificity = 1,0,0,0 */
```

### Rendering

When the renderer is created and added to the tree, it does not have a position and size. Calculating these values is called layout or reflow.

HTML uses a flow based layout model, meaning that most of the time it is possible to compute the geometry in a single pass. Elements later "in the flow" typically do not affect the geometry of elements that are earlier "in the flow", so layout can proceed left-to-right, top-to-bottom through the document. There are exceptions: for example, HTML tables may require more than one pass. Layout is a recursive process. It begins at the root renderer, which corresponds to the `<html>` element of the HTML document. Layout continues recursively through some or all of the frame hierarchy, computing geometric information for each renderer that requires it. All renderers have a "layout" or "reflow" method, each renderer invokes the layout method of its children that need layout.

__Dirty bit system:__ In order not to do a full layout for every small change, browsers use a "dirty bit" system. A renderer that is changed or added marks itself and its children as "dirty": needing layout. There are two flags: "dirty", and "children are dirty" which means that although the renderer itself may be OK, it has at least one child that needs a layout.

__Global and incremental layout:__ Layout can be triggered on the entire render treeâ€“this is "global" layout. This can happen as a result of a global style change that affects all renderers, like a font size change, or as a result of a screen being resized. Layout can be incremental, only the dirty renderers will be laid out (this can cause some damage which will require extra layouts). Incremental layout is triggered (asynchronously) when renderers are dirty. For example when new renderers are appended to the render tree after extra content came from the network and was added to the DOM tree.

When a layout is triggered by a "resize" or a change in the renderer position(and not size), the renders sizes are taken from a cache and not recalculated..
In some cases only a sub tree is modified and layout does not start from the root. This can happen in cases where the change is local and does not affect its surroundingsâ€“like text inserted into text fields (otherwise every keystroke would trigger a layout starting from the root).

__The layout process:__

* Parent renderer determines its own width.
* Parent goes over children and:
  * Place the child renderer (sets its x and y).
  * Calls child layout if needed â€“ they are dirty or we are in a global layout, or for some other reason â€“ which calculates the child's height.
* Parent uses children's accumulative heights and the heights of margins and padding to set its own height â€“ this will be used by the parent renderer's parent.
* Sets its dirty bit to false.

__Width calculation:__ The renderer's width is calculated using the container block's width, the renderer's style "width" property, the margins and borders.

Would be calculated by WebKit as the following:

* The container width is the maximum of the containers availableWidth and 0. The availableWidth in this case is the contentWidth which is calculated as:
```
clientWidth() - paddingLeft() - paddingRight()
```
clientWidth and clientHeight represent the interior of an object excluding border and scrollbar.
* The elements width is the "width" style attribute. It will be calculated as an absolute value by computing the percentage of the container width.
* The horizontal borders and paddings are now added.

The values are cached in case a layout is needed, but the width does not change.

__Painting:__ In the painting stage, the render tree is traversed and the renderer's "paint()" method is called to display content on the screen. Painting uses the UI infrastructure component. Like layout, painting can also be global â€“ the entire tree is painted â€“ or incremental. In incremental painting, some of the renderers change in a way that does not affect the entire tree. The changed renderer invalidates its rectangle on the screen. This causes the OS to see it as a "dirty region" and generate a "paint" event. The OS does it cleverly and coalesces several regions into one. In Chrome it is more complicated because the renderer is in a different process then the main process. Chrome simulates the OS behavior to some extent. The presentation listens to these events and delegates the message to the render root. The tree is traversed until the relevant renderer is reached. It will repaint itself (and usually its children).

__The painting order:__ CSS2 defines the order of the painting process. This is actually the order in which the elements are stacked in the stacking contexts. This order affects painting since the stacks are painted from back to front. The stacking order of a block renderer is:

* background color
* background image
* border
* children
* outline

__Optimizations:__ Firefox goes over the render tree and builds a display list for the painted rectangular. It contains the renderers relevant for the rectangular, in the right painting order (backgrounds of the renderers, then borders etc). That way the tree needs to be traversed only once for a repaint instead of several timesâ€“painting all backgrounds, then all images, then all borders etc. Firefox optimizes the process by not adding elements that will be hidden, like elements completely beneath other opaque elements.

Before repainting, WebKit saves the old rectangle as a bitmap. It then paints only the delta between the new and old rectangles.

__Dynamic changes:__ The browsers try to do the minimal possible actions in response to a change. So changes to an elements color will cause only repaint of the element. Changes to the element position will cause layout and repaint of the element, its children and possibly siblings. Adding a DOM node will cause layout and repaint of the node. Major changes, like increasing font size of the "html" element, will cause invalidation of caches, relayout and repaint of the entire tree.

__The rendering engine's threads:__ The rendering engine is single threaded. Almost everything, except network operations, happens in a single thread. In Firefox and Safari this is the main thread of the browser. In Chrome it's the tab process main thread. Network operations can be performed by several parallel threads. The number of parallel connections is limited (usually 2â€“6 connections).
