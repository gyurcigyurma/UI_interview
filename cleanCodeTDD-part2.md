There are managers Uncle Bob, who either through ignorance or disagreement, will never allow their programmers to practice test-driven development. 
But why should your boss have to know? I mean, do you ask your boss if you can use semi-colons? Do you ask your boss if you should indent your if statements? When's the last time you asked your boss if you could go to the bathroom? Test-driven development is a personal practice, permission is not required. - And still, they will object. (electronic beeping) - If your boss questions you about test-driven development, tell him you do it in order to go faster. If he objects, tell him that you'll have to double all your estimates. If he continues to object, then tell him to mind his own business, because after all, you are the software expert, not your boss. - Fascinating. Programmer's behaving as professionals? I'd not thought it possible. (electronic beeping) My next objection, Uncle Bob, is that refactoring is rework. (electronical beeping) It would be better to write the code correctly the first time. (electronic beeping) - Well, when you figure out how to do that, you let me know cause I'd be real interested. Meanwhile, every creative effort on the planet is done iteratively. Portrait painter's don't paint the perfect portrait the first time, song writers don't write the perfect song the first time, journalist's don't write the perfect article the first time, and programmer's don't write perfect code the first time either. When you were in third grade, your teacher probably asked you to write a story. And then she told you how to do it. She said, first write an outline, then write a rough draft, then a second draft, then a third draft and then maybe the final copy. We are taught from a very early age that creative work requires iteration and rework. And then when we become a programmer, we can alter reality and write everything correctly the first time. I mean that's laughable, right? Of course, it's going to take several passes to get the code right. Of course, it requires refinement and rework to do things well. Of course, we're not going to write it right the first time.
